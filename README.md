### installation and usage
This project require following module.
TensorFlow
Six
h5py
And You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an Jupyter Notebook`
it one may need anaconda shoulde be installed(including numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter) ( https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install ) or install python 2.7 and then install Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, matplotlib,jupyter manually as follows.
